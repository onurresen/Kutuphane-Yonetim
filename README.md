# Kutuphane-Yonetim
When I create this project I was too inexperienced. Please consider this.

My first Java Swing project for school. Date 12-2019

I used MySql for database on this project.

If you want to use, just enter your connection information into My_CNX.

You can find database files on DatabaseFiles.

You can import kutuphane.sql by using MySql.
