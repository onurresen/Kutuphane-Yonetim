# Kutuphane-Yonetim
My first Java Swing project for school. Date 12-2019

I used MySql for database on this project.
This is my first Java project and I learned this language on it.

If you want to use, just enter your connection information into My_CNX
You can find database files on DatabaseFiles
You can import kutuphane.sql by using MySql
